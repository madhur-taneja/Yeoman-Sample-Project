# Yeoman Sample Project

* This repo contains sample project made for learning the implementation of yeoman and bootstrap theme rolling. To do the same, follow the below mentioned steps:

## Steps to build an app:

> Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
> After setting up node, download and install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Use the following command:
* `npm install -g yo`
> After setting up yeoman, install a generator for the project according to the requirements. Search for them from [here](http://yeoman.io/generators/). I have used [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp). Use the following command:
* `npm install -g generator-webapp`
> To scaffold a new project, run:
* `yo webapp`
> Most generators will ask a series of questions to customize the new project. To see which options are available, use the help command:
* `yo webapp --help`
> A lot of generators rely on build systems (like Grunt or Gulp), and package managers (like npm and Bower). Make sure to visit the generator’s site to learn about running and maintaining the new app. Easily access a generator’s home page by running:
* `npm home generator-webapp`
> Most issues can be found by running:
* `yo doctor`

## Steps for using Bootstrap theme rolling:

> Open [Bootstrap Build](https://bootstrap.build/app/v4.1.1/) or any other website that provides bootstrap custom theme builder.

> Adjust the values according to your need.

> Export the file and link it to your project.
